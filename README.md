### Hi there 👋
_ABOUT_ _ME_
👩‍🎓 I am a 15-year-old student at Tagore International, juggling the worlds of academia, coding, and music. 📚🖥️🎹
💻 As a budding coder, I'm dedicated to honing my skills in the digital realm. 🖥️👩‍💻 
🎹 Music flows through my veins, and I find solace in the harmonious notes of the piano. 🎶🎹  
🎙️ I thrive in the spotlight, enjoying the thrill of public speaking. 🗣️ 
📚 Reading is my refuge, and I have a penchant for poetry, crafting verses that resonate with the soul. 📖✍️ 

_ACHIEVEMENTS_
🏆 Among my achievements, I proudly hold the title of International Rank II in the 21st International Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Competition of 2016. 🥈 
💃 Having graduated in Kathak from Lucknow University of Classical Dance in 2022, dance is not just a hobby, but a cherished passion. 💃🩰 
🎭 I made waves by making it to the semi-finals of India's Best Dramebaaz on Sony TV, a testament to my dramatic flair.
